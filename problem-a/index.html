        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimus_Prime">Optimus Prime</a> is a fictional character from the popular media franchise Transformers.
        In the world of Transformers, he like everyone else is a Cybertronian which are sentient robot
        lifeforms that can transform into many things like vehicles, animals, etc. In most cases, he transforms 
        into a red and blue semi-truck. He serves as the leader of the Autobots, a faction of Transformers who 
        are at war of the opposing faction, the Decepticons.

            I admire his sense of leadership as he's known to be a selfless leader that strives for justice and inspires fellow
            Autobots to do the same.

        <li>
            I admire the bravery and courage he processes as he's willing to risk his own life to protect and ensure safety for his people

            I admire the voice actor of Optimus Prime, Peter Cullen and his portrayal of the character as his talent
            brings out the heroic qualities of Optimus Prime.
